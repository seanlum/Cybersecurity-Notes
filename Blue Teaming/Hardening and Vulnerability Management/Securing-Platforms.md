# Securing Platforms

There are several bodies of knowledge under the United States which allow users to secure content on their networks. On different types of networks, there are different kinds of devices. But ultimately on computer networks; the end-user devices are subscribers to three types of addressing models: `virtual`, `wired`, and `wireless`. These include a wide variety of addressing protocols and standards which have their own best practices and content security recommendations. There are different standards for different types of networking devices and surface area definitions within an organization. Ultimately there are the following domains: `Supply Chain`, `Cloud`, `PC Server`, `PC Client`, `Software`, `Mobile Client`, `Networking`, and `IoT`. In the USA there are standards on compliance and testing for each type of domain. And ultimately they boil down to different compliance groups for non-classified operations. Within these compliance groups are `OWASP`, `PTES`, `MITRE`, `ISECOM`, `CIS`, `DoD`, and `NIST`. The various standards mainly resolve around the `continual DevSecOps` lifecycles which may occur at various states within an organization. The lines between the blue team and the red team are becoming increasingly blurred; and may be a responsibility of a security professional at various parts of the IT lifecycles related to cybersecurity. There are also concepts which are applied to these models which include `Zero Trust Architecture`, `Defense in Depth`, securing against the `Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain` and these have various levels of security awareness which restrict access and harden security. There is also growth of continual penetration testing inside of the DevSecOps lifecycle. Ultimately this is all managed with a `Risk Management Framework` which may be mapped with a `Cyber Security Framework` using a `Secure Software Development Framework`.


First there are baselines which are established through a variety of steps.
- Planning The System
  - Supply chain selection and hardware selection
  - Policies and Standards 
  - Inventory and Assets Management
  - Risk Estimation
  - Asset Classification
  - Initial Environment Configuration
    - DMZ Servers
    - Infrastructure
    - Security Systems
    - Cloud Access
- Develop The Endpoints
  - Device network membership
  - Device administration configuration
  - Device policy and software configuration
  - Asset deployment and userspace preparation
- Build the Environment on the Endpoint
- New endpoint first login


Overall, when it comes to a formal penetration test within an organization; there are various modes which can be used to run tests. Eventually, once the blue team has configured the settings; the red team will break and test the new settings. But before the red team can start penetration testing on the network, the blue team has to establish a baseline. Ultimately it boils down regions of `OSSTMM`, `OWASP Developers Guide`, and `PTES`
