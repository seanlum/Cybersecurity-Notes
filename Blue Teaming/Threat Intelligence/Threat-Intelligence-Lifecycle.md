3. Processing - ingest the data, sort the data, prioritize and triage tha data, establish data source channels and platforms for intelligence generation
4. Analysis - analyze the data according to the requirements phase, produce actionable intelligence which can be used to perform intelligence activities, security activities, and establish flows of threats
5. Dissemination - Present findings in reports, slide decks, data sources, dashboards, and other methods of sharing data
7. Feedback - Get information from reports and identify potential improvements or actions to be taken based on the intelligence produced
