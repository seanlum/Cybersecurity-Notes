# OPML Repositories


# Information and Cyber Security RSS/Atom Feeds
This is my very personal and opinionatedly organized infosec/cybersec sources in one OPML file. I don't know to what extent I'll be able to curate it, but for now I wanted to get it out.

Here's what you can expect to find in here, in a rough order of descending priority. Why normalized, flattened as opposed to nested folders? Because seme readers (e.g., the great Inoreader) don't support nested folders.
