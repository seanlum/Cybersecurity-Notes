These are the values of the HackTricks Project:

- Give FREE access to EDUCATIONAL hacking resources to ALL Internet.
  - Hacking is about learning, and learning should be as free as possible.
  - The purpose of this book is to serve as a comprehensive educational resource.
- STORE awesome hacking techniques that the community publishes giving the ORIGINAL AUTHORS all the credits.
  - We don't want the credit from other people, we just want to store cool tricks for everyone.
  - We also write our own researches in HackTricks.
  - In several cases we will just write in HackTricks a summary of the important parts of the technique and will encourage the lector to visit the original post for more details.

- ORGANIZE all the hacking techniques in the book so it's MORE ACCESSIBLE
  - The HackTricks team has dedicated thousands of hours for free only to organize the content so people can learn faster
